This is a very quick and dirty port of the tcpdrop utility from OpenBSD
and FreeBSD to Solaris.  Tested on Solaris 9 and 10.

On Solaris 10, this utility requires the sys_ip_config privilege.
Since this privilege cannot be asserted in a local zone, it is not
possible to use this utility in a local zone.

Thanks to Casper Dik for pointing out the TCP_IOC_ABORT_CONN ioctl.

http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/on/usr/src/cmd/zoneadmd/vplat.c
provided all the documentation on its use, and so certain portions of
this file are covered by the CDDL included in the tar file.

The original work is covered by a BSD license.
