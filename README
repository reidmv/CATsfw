This is a collection of hackjob scripts which theCAT used to compile and
package samaba + dependencies on Solaris 10. If we start having to do this
on a regular basis (compile and build packages for Solaris) we may like, 
make it not a hackjob or something. Until then, it's still useful to us even
if only for samba and only for our particular environment. So here it is in
a repo. :)

The way it works right now is:

 1. `cd` into the relevant package directory (e.g. CATsamba). 
 2. Run the local "build.sh" script.
 3. Screw with the "build.sh" script until it works.
 4. (Optional) If you did something to make it better, pat yourself on the
    back! Way to be! Commit the betterments.
 5. Find .pkg.gz file in the pkg/ subdirectory. Upload it to your repo or
    whatever you use to distribute packages to your solaris boxen.
 6. Profit!
